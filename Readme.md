# Spheres with electric field

Simulation of the behavior of spheres (with charge) in a electric field, generated by other spheres.

It also includes a representation of the electric field generated by the bodies in all scenes. The visualisation of the field lines only are enabled in the scenes 3, 4 and 5.

# Scenes

1. **Scene-01:** A ring of spheres.
2. **Scene-02:** Two ring of sphere separated in the same distance in the z axis.
3. **Scene-03:** A dipole, with field lines visible.
4. **Scene-04:** A quadrupole, with field lines visible.
5. **Scene-05:** An octopole, with field lines visible.
